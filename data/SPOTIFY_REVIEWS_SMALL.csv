Also love the fact that I never have to download music from the web or buy it from overpriced iTunes again. However, it's not a huge deal, but a heads-up would have been nice... To those whining about having to listen to music on shuffle mode: what do you expect? The artists have to make money somehow, right? So if you wanna listen to the music of YOUR choice whenever YOU like on all of your little gadgets, quit crying and cough up the $10/month...it's really not much. You're never gonna be able to legally own your music without paying for it...  And lastly - please make AC/DC available to us :) thanks",5,1,"1.1.0.113","2014-05-28 20:52:13"

I went to open Spotify on the train today &...I'm told to DL the new app. I have to wait until I'm outside of the trains to do that. Then, I have to redownload my playlist music?? Which I couldn't do until I was home again. 2hrs on the train & I couldn't access the music service I paid for. Not cool. Why didn't you guys just make a patch of the old version? Incredibly inconvenienced today.",2,0,"1.1.0.113","2014-05-29 19:41:44"

Why would you create a whole new app that makes the old one completely useless and deletes all of my music? And i cant even downlowd my whole goddamn playlist! It got maybe 1/4 of the songs and decided to stop downloading. I pay forthis to listen to music and enjoy myself. Not get frustrated at not being able to listen to music on my phone. Also, when you announced the new app, weren't we all told that we wouldnt have to redownload music?",1,0,"1.1.0.113","2014-05-30 14:13:53"

In Frankfurt, just before entering the plane for the 8 hours flight I start spotify and it shortly say; You can't use this, you must install the new one! I were like, wtf? Usually people can chose when they like to update but not here, force update and old version wont work. Fk! So alright, I download the latest version while taking my seat, not my country data traffic sucking my money, thanks. When installed I'm informed that I have to download all offline content again, WTF FK!  Thanks for that.  When I arrive to the hotel in India I start to download my playlists again, not the fastest wifi so I had to pick just some of the music.  After a week I'm at Mumbai airport and on my way back, start spotify and guess what, the same fkn message, update again, all offline content deleted, you have to download again. Yeah, phat chance I do that in India without wifi.  The last two updates suck goatballs.  Another thing, the new interface, black, colours good, but all the spacing between the lines, seriously, all the scrolling to see just one album?

That is no longer true. A grouping of 12 or so songs is on a constant loop and only one song gets played by the artist selected. In this particular case, the artist I chose has 16 full albums available in their entirety on Spotify. So I know it's not an issue of song availability.

Beats Music has an amazing curated playlist, but it lacks the social and discovery feature Rdio and Spotify offer. Beats Music is horrible at showing you ""new releases"". If Beats Music can fix their new releases and social discovery problems. Then Beats Music will win me back. Their playlist are so good. Good enough to win me back. Rdio is nearly perfect, and it just as good as Spotify. And before the recent Spotify re-design, Rdio had my wallet and my ears. Rdio, just like Spotify, has the best balance of discovery, social and new music. So why did I leave Rdio? Spotify has good playlists. Not as good as Beats Music, but it's still good. For now, Spotify is the winner. It has everything I need in a music service. Being a long time Rdio subscriber I'm worried for Rdio's future. Beats Music however has tremendous potential. Their playlist are that good, and their UI is fun and delightful. Beats Music just needs to hurry up before it's too late.",4,4,"1.1.2.449","2014-07-04 19:00:02"

Selection of music is generous and should satisfy most folks.  The main reason I'm giving it only 3 stars is  1. Audio quality - It's acceptable, but not great. Even at ""extreme quality"" which is touted as 320 kbps Ogg. The audio always sounds like there's a veil between over the music and not as lively or warm as from other streaming services or CD. I've tried Google Play All Access (320 kbps MP3) and Sony Music Unlimited (320 Kbps AAC), and in terms of audio quality Sony> Google >Spotify. I've used ogg, and there shouldn't be such a discrepancy. Either Spotify messes up the conversion to Ogg, it's not really 320 kbps, or the original masters provided to Ogg aren't good.  2. Music discovery. I prefer the music discovery feature in Sony Music Unlimited, where they highly playlists everyr week that coincide with a theme or artists that just release new music. They also highlight new music releases every week.   If Spotify improves on both this features,  I will consider coming back as Spotify does offer much more competitive subscription rates.",3,0,"1.1.2.449","2014-07-05 20:46:22"

I also love getting the emails to help me discover new artists based on the music I listen to. This has really helped me love this app even more.",5,0,"1.1.2.449","2014-07-07 08:29:16"
